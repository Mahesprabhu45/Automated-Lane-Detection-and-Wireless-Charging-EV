🚗 Automated Lane Detection EV

This project is an Arduino-based electric vehicle capable of automatically detecting and following lanes using IR sensors while controlling motion through an L298N motor driver. The wireless charging coil system enables the vehicle to recharge without physical connectors, and a voltage sensor monitors battery level during operation. The logic is simple: the vehicle moves forward when no line is detected, turns left or right based on individual sensor detection, and stops when both sensors detect the line simultaneously. A 16x2 I2C LCD displays system status in real time, and the entire system runs from a rechargeable battery with regulated power supply. All hardware diagrams, flowcharts, block diagrams, code, and images are included to clearly represent the working model, hardware connections, and behavior of the automated system. This project demonstrates sensor-based navigation, embedded motor control, and wireless power transfer in a compact EV prototype.
